3. RC Shell. RC (for "run commands") is the command line interpreter for Version 10 Unix and Plan 9 from Bell Labs operating systems. It resembles the Bourne shell, but its syntax is somewhat simpler.

4. Mksh- Mksh is the MirBSD Korn Shell, an actively developed free implementation of the Korn Shell programming language and a successor to the Public Domain Korn Shell (pdksh). It is developed as part of the MirOS Project as native Bourne/POSIX/Korn shell for MirOS BSD, but also to be readily available under other UNIX-like operating systems. It targets users who desire a compact, fast, reliable, secure shell not cut off modern extensions, with unicode support.

Because of its speed, POSIX compliance, and advanced features, it is ideally suited for scripting. But it can serve very well as a login shell too. It is used as default shell on Android.

5. Tenex C Shell- The Tenex C Shell Tcsh is the Tenex Csh, and offers many improvements to the standard csh, while remaining totally compatible with csh.
